<p>It’s been an interesting journey to write an article to post for SysAdvent, primo spot of Christmas eve. The idea of doing a talk sometime next year was talked amongst my team so I asked around how to start. CFP is where you start, often talks can be derived from a blog post you do thus making the best thing to do to work towards a talk is write. Although I may have some topics I can talk about regarding technology, I felt like none of them are worthy of a talk, it is not necessarily ground breaking. However, there is something I can share that is unique and can be useful for the community.</p>

<h2 id="how-am-i-unique">How am I unique</h2>
<p>Realistically, we are all unique. The path we have taken, decisions that have been made, each lead us to a permutation that is unique, at least within our vicinity of our social groups. What would be better than to share about my career path? A database administrator is a pretty niche of a position, one that some may aspire to but because its so niche, where to begin is an oddball. Visibility of the career ladder simply does not exist, there isn’t a bachelors degree nor accessible repositories containing code that would you help you learn how databases work. It’s raw documentation and without much guidance and hands-on work in the field, you’re left in the dust.</p>

<p>I felt like how I got into the field is an interesting story, it was half purposeful and half unintentional. I delve into the story a bit more in the article but to overall sum, backend and databases is something that always drew me closer. Databases is something I always viewed as a vault making it even more exciting. It’s need to be protected without degradation to performance. My first and foremost goal was to get into the field since once you are in, you’re in. I picked up anything and everything I could, I wanted my foot in the door. My second goal was to move towards the backend, once you learn how it works the ability to be creative with defending the backend becomes easier. My last phase is security. My hope is by then I know how to break what I can build, making it easy to transition into a role that allows me wreck havoc.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-feel">How do I feel?</h2>
<p>It’s an honor to be able to post something that is a tradition within the technology community, something I cannot remove, it’s now officially glued to the internet for as long as it’s alive. It is a new feeling, as any time I wrote something I typically had the ability to remove it. It was so miniscules that my words becoming immortal was not a worry at all. Not anymore.</p>

<p>All in all it’s an honor, it was fun, and I hope to do another one soon.</p>
