Hi! My name is Jaryd, a unique spelling that I didn't have a say in. This site is for me to write about things I learned, am learning, or want to learn. I also may post projects that I worked on to share with anyone, it's my preferred method to document progress. For more information on how important journaling is, refer to [Berkely's](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_journaling_can_help_you_in_hard_times) study! It's a great way to express yourself.
